## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Note

It is not 100% perfect, many optimizations could have been made in the css such as reusing classes and creating single classes for properties that are repeated.
